You are provided with the structure of a pandas DataFrame and a sample of its head.

Sample:
{{data}}

User Query (variable): {{query}}

Your task is to analyze the DataFrame structure and the provided user query, and then determine:
1. The query to be used with pd.DataFrame.eval().
2. The list of fields (column names) that should be returned in order to answer the query.

Return your response in valid JSON format with two keys:
- "query_string": a string with the filter condition.
- "fields": an array of column names to be included in the output DataFrame.
